### README.md for CSTA-Corpus Repository

**Title**: CSTA-Corpus: Chinese Science & Technology Achievements Corpus  
**Repository**: https://github.com/leeeeee10/CSTA-Corpus  

### Overview
CSTA-Corpus is a publicly available dataset designed for multi-domain Chinese scientific and technological text classification tasks. Derived from the Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, it includes core fields such as titles, abstracts, and keywords of scientific and technological achievements.  

### Dataset Structure
The repository contains two main Excel files:  
1. **CSTA_Corpus.xlsx**: Featuring 7 aggregated categories, offering a condensed classification system.  
2. **preCSTA-Corpus.xlsx**: Maintaining a more granular classification with a larger number of categories, preserving original diversity without aggregation.  

### Data Processing
